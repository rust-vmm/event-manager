//! A manager remote endpoint allows user to interact with the `EventManger` (as a `SubscriberOps`
//! trait object) from a different thread of execution.
//!
//! This is particularly useful when the `EventManager` owns (via `EventManager::add_subscriber`)
//! a subscriber object the user needs to work with (via `EventManager::subscriber_mut`), but the
//! `EventManager` being on a different thread requires synchronized handles.
//!
//! Until more sophisticated methods are explored (for example making the `EventManager` offer
//! interior mutability using something like an RCU mechanism), the current approach relies on
//! passing boxed closures to the manager and getting back a boxed result. The manager is notified
//! about incoming invocation requests via an `EventFd` which is added to the epoll event set.
//! The signature of the closures as they are received is the `FnOnceBox` type alias defined
//! below. The actual return type is opaque to the manager, but known to the initiator. The manager
//! runs each closure to completion, and then returns the boxed result using a sender object that
//! is part of the initial message that also included the closure.
